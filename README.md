# Descriptive Statistics – Investment Returns Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a small **Descriptive Statistics analysis** performed on an investment returns dataset. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate core **statistics concepts using Python (Pandas, NumPy)** in a clean, GitHub‑ready format.

This is suitable for:

* Beginners in **Data Science / AI / ML**
* Interview preparation (statistics + Pandas)
* Portfolio demonstration of data understanding
